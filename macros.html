		<heading>What are Macros</heading>
<paragraph>Macros are what make up food, it is short for macronutrients. Macros can be broken down into three groups, protein, carbohyrdrates and fats. These three groups all have different functions when they are eaten all of which are required by the body to grow and change. In the paragraphs below there will be a deeper look at what each of these do.</paragraph>
<br>
<br>
<paragraph>Proteins are what make up the muscles and are crucial for when recovering after taking part in a physical activity eg lifiting weights. When taking part in a phyical activity the muscles are torn and whilst recovering they are healed back together stronger than before, proteins are essential for this process and consuming more protein can lead to increased recovery rate allowing physical activities to be undertaken more often.</paragraph>
<br>
<br>
<paragraph>Carbohydrates can be broken down into two different groups, complex carbohydrates and simple carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates are broken down by the body slower and therefore allow the body to stay fueled longer than if you consume simple carbohydrates. All carbohydrates are used to fuel the body and are ideally taken before taking part in a physical activity to allow the body to work better throught the activity.</paragraph>
<br>
<br>
<paragraph>Fats can be broken down saturated fats and unsaturated fats. Fats are used by the human body to burn energy when the body has no carbohydrates to burn. Fats are usually stored in the body until they are ready to be used. For this reason fats are usually the lowest amount of macro to be consumed regardless of the goal. </paragraph>
